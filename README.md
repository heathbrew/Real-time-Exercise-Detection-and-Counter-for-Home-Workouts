# Real-time Exercise Detection and Counter for Home Workouts
## 1. Problem Statement
With the rise of remote work and home workouts, there is an increasing need for a cost-effective, easy-to-use solution for tracking exercise form and count. Traditional methods require manual counting, which is prone to errors and distractions.
## 2. Solution
The project aims to create an automated, real-time exercise detection and counting system that utilizes computer vision to monitor and count five types of exercises: Push-ups, Bicep Curls, Squats, Sit-ups, and Lunges. The software provides immediate visual feedback, allowing users to improve their form and track their progress.
## 3. Tech Stack Used
•	Python
•	OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
•	MediaPipe by Google
•	NumPy
## 4. Organization/Institution : Asian Dynamic Grace limited
## 5. Individual/Team : Individual
## 6. Duration : 1 Month
## 8. Observations
•	The program can successfully detect and count the five different exercises with a high degree of accuracy.
•	Needs adequate lighting and simple background for best results.
•	The system can be further enhanced by adding more exercises and integrating machine learning algorithms for more complex pose detection.
